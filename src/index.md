For me, the aim is straightforward: make accessible websites that perform well and respect people’s privacy. Puzzles dealing with layout and design are my favorite to solve. Exploring the limits of layout on the web while adhering to web standards and best practices is my idea of dream work.

If you have a project that could use my help, I’m [available for hire](mailto:{{ data.email }}).
