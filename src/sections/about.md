I'm a web designer and developer focused on pushing layout limits, accessibility, and web standards. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. Europe is the third continent I've called home; I've been living in Stockholm with my wife Emma for almost three years. When I am not working on web stuff I enjoy activities that require extreme observation like taking pictures and bird watching.
