name: Kandinsky's Birthday
description: To demonstrate some of the capabilities of CSS, I led a workshop in my Hyper Island Frontend Developer class where we transformed a poster into a layout on the web. The workshop was a chance to dive deeper into CSS grid and to revisit the steps to make a layout responsive from the start.
